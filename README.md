Get a random wallpaper from http://wallhaven.cc and install it
(uses nitrogen by default).

The script offers various filter options to pick only wallpapers
to your liking. You can configure it directly inside the script
or per command line arguments (command line arguments will
override settings made directly in the script)

Loosely based on https://github.com/macearl/Wallhaven-Downloader
